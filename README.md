# Django_books_project
This is my project where I learn Django framework.
To run the project on your computer:
  1. Install Django like this - **pip install Django**
  2. You just have to create a django project like this - **django-admin startproject project_name**
  3. Then you can clone the repo.
  4. You can create an app like this - **python manage.py startapp projectApp** or **django-admin startapp projectApp**
  5. Delete whole content of you app folder except the __pycache__ and **migrations** folder.
  6. To the app folder paste **myapp** content from the repo
  7. In your project folder paste **bookr** content from repo 


*This project is not focused on looks so don't blame me.*
