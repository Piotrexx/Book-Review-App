# Django_books_project
This is my project where I learn Django framework.
To run the project on your computer:
  1. Install Django - **pip install Django**
  2. you just have to create a django project **django-admin startproject project_name**
  3. Then you can clone the repo.



*This project is not focused on looks so don't blame me.*
