# My Django Book Review Website

## Introduction

In this project I learn basics of Django framework for Python programming language.
Website is about posting rewievs of books, adding books and more. 
I learn Django from this book [Web Development with Django](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Development-Django-applications-Python-based/dp/1839212500)
I really recommend this book for beginners, it's really well documented.

# WARNING !

**IT IS WORTH TO NOTICE THAT I DON'T PUT ALL THE FILES IN THE REPOSITORY !**

I don't put files like: 
 - files from folder __pychache__
 - migrations

 
Those files goes with the Django framework when app or project created.

For better experiance first create project like this:

```shell
django-admin startproject project_name
```

And then create an app just like this:

```shell
python manage.py startapp app_name
```

After this you can copy all the files.

**Files from bookr folder goes to your project folder**

**Files from myapp folder goes to your app folder**
